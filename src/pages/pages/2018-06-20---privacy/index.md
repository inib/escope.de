### third parties involved

This site uses some services from third parties to ensure a enjoyable experience. Your browser will therefore not only send requests to netlify servers, but also to third party servers such as google or youtube to request data. Third parties may also use your requests to gather data from you, this may include tracking and the use of third party cookies.

#### webkit fonts

This site uses webfonts via the google API. By accessing this site your browser automaticly requests data from google.

#### google analytics

this site uses google analytics to give me an idea, what people are interested in and where they came from, when visiting my site. As much as I hate this, as useful it is, so I'm still using it.

#### embedded content

Some pages may include embedded content, so your browser requests data from third party sites such as youtube.com. By opening a site with embedded content from a third party content service, your browser directly requests data from this service.

I try to mark every embedded object and it's origin, so you can easily find their own privacy policies.

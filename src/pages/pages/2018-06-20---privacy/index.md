## The data on this website

This website runs on a server located in a german data center. The server is managed and maintained by myself, no third parties should have access to the files. 

### what data

When visiting this website you leave a minimalistic footprint in the logfiles of my server. This includes your public IP address and the data your browser sends for the handshake and content requests.

### what happens with the data

The data gets written to a log file, that helps me to identify problems and attacks to my server as well as faulty links. There are some algorithms that scan the log files for attacks, including repeatedly send false requests and roboting the site structure.

After 7 days the log files get minified, the IP gets anonymized and archived. This allows me to generate yearly statistics of my site. With the generation of this statistics the archived data gets deleted.

### third parties involved

This site uses some services from third parties to ensure a enjoyable experience. Your browser will therefore not only send requests to my server, but also to third party servers such as google or youtube to request data. Third parties may also use your requests to gather data from you, this may include tracking of third party cookies.

#### webkit fonts

This site uses webfonts via the google API. By accessing this site your browser automaticly requests data from google.

#### embedded content

Some pages may include embedded content, so your browser requests data from third party sites such as youtube.com. By opening a site with embedded content from a third party content service, your browser directly requests data from this service.

I try to mark every embedded object and it's origin, so you can easily find their own privacy policies.

### what can you do

You can enjoy your visit on my site, if you're okay with what I'm doing with this data. If you disagree, you can not only not visit my site, but also request the removal of your data from my logfiles.

Hint: If you want to visit the web anonymously: get a VPN, disable cookies and use your browsers incognito features.

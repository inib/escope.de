## the printers I use

### Original Prusa MK3S

The Prusa MK3S is currently my flexible workhorse. It's not the fanciest printer, it does not have the biggest buildplate and it's not the fastest printer, but whatever model I throw at it, it just prints it.
Most importantly with its unique heatbed, it can calibrate itself and reproduces reliable dimensions.

It also features extended self monitoring. This is the only printer I really trust, when I'm not around.

### Anycubic 4MAX

This is my first printer and got me into this hobby. It's a different approach to the Ultimaker with a gantry design and lowering Z-bed. Since it's enclosed and has decent heating capabilities, this is the perfect machine for higher temperatures.

I'm currently updating the direct drive system to an BMG Aero approach.

### Anet A8 Plus

No printer line-up without a Anet kit? Yes and no: I bought this guy to give my Titan Aero a new home. Together with a Volcano hotend and a 0.8 mm nozzle this thing eats spools of filament in no time.

I never even bothered using the original hotend and electronics. Don't ask me if this abomination could actually work out of the box.

### Tevo Michelangelo

This ready-to-go printer from Tevo was on sale and I was weak. Surprisingly this printer produces detail with PLA, I never thought a 3D printer could manage and not for under 200 â‚¬ right out of the box. With PLA it outclasses all my other printer including the Prusa in terms of speed and detail.

After some iterations of custom hotend designs, I now run this guy with an E3D V6 hotend and a 0.3 mm nozzle.
